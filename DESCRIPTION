Description: Performs hypothesis testing for general block designs with
    empirical likelihood. The core computational routines are implemented
    using the 'Eigen' C++ library and 'RcppEigen' interface, with OpenMP
    for parallel computation. Details of the methods are given in Kim,
    MacEachern, and Peruggia (2023) <doi:10.1080/10485252.2023.2206919>.
