Title: Multiple Empirical Likelihood Tests
Version: 0.9.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Eunseop", "Kim", , "kim.7302@osu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Performs hypothesis testing for general block designs with
    empirical likelihood. The core computational routines are implemented
    using the 'Eigen' C++ library and 'RcppEigen' interface, with OpenMP
    for parallel computation.  Details of the testing procedures are given
    in Kim, MacEachern, and Peruggia (2021) <arxiv:2112.09206>.
